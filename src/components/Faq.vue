      <p>
        Like a board game, a role-playing game is played by sitting around a
        table with your friends. <br />But, as a role-playing game, A Thousand
        Faces of Adventure is a little different. It's asymmetrical.
        <br /><br />One friend plays the "GM" role and is playing with different
        rules from the others The action takes place in a shared, imagined
        world. It's like collaborative group storytelling Like a "legacy" board
        game, the state of the game changes by playing it. <br /><br />Players
        change their characters from one session to the next, and the entire
        fantasy world changes too The story and challenges are improvised! A
        Thousand Faces of Adventure lays out a series of milestones and prompts,
        but you need to play to find out the details of what happens
