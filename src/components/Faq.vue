        <p>
          Like a board game, a role-playing game is played by sitting around a
          table with your friends. <br />But, as a role-playing game, A Thousand
          Faces of Adventure is a little different. It's asymmetrical.
          <br /><br />One friend plays the "GM" role and is playing with
          different rules from the others The action takes place in a shared,
          imagined world. It's like collaborative group storytelling Like a
          "legacy" board game, the state of the game changes by playing it.
          <br /><br />Players change their characters from one session to the
          next, and the entire fantasy world changes too The story and
          challenges are improvised! A Thousand Faces of Adventure lays out a
          series of milestones and prompts, but you need to play to find out the
          details of what happens
