          A Thousand Faces of Adventure takes the deck-building and
          set-collection mechanisms of modern board games like Gloomhaven and
          marries them with the innovation blossoming in indie role-playing
          games like Fate and Dungeon World.

          for the right RPG to introduce them to the world of

          designed for you.

          When new players sit down to play, there's no hundred-page tome
          they're expected to navigate, just familiar-looking board game
          components. The GM can walk the players through a well-tested ten-step
          process that creates the characters and their world
          <strong>in 45 minutes</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 max-w-2xl px-4">
          Furthermore, <strong>all the math is baked-in</strong>. The
          probability curves are carefully designed and distributed into a
          20-card deck, so players only need to flip a card and see the result
          on the face.
